I am a Java developer and I want you to develop developing a game for me. It is a number guessing game played between
a computer and a person, who is the player. The game starts when the player holds a 4-digit number in her memory. Then
computer tries to find it by giving several guesses. The number can't have any repeating digit and can't start with 0.
Each try that the computer makes is a 4-digit number and the player evaluates the guess and returns an answer with
some description. The description has + (plus) for each digit in correct place and - (minus) for each digit in wrong place.
For example the player holds 5174 and the computer's guess is 1234 the the answer would be +1 and -1. Second guess
might be 6890 and then the answer would be 0. Whenever the answer is +4 then it means the guess is correct which means
the computer guesses the number correctly and the game finishes.

Can you give me the code for this game in Java? Please use basic array to store numbers, don't use List or any other
collection of Java. This code will be used in a training to teach Java new comers. So make the code clean and explained well.
